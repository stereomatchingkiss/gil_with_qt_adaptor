This repository is under developing of the factory to bind
Qt and GIL easier.
Things have to be done
1 : unit test for dynamic factory
2 : support of bit aligned view 
3 : log,since c++11 and boost still lag log, it is hard to determine
    what kind of log system should I use, there are too many of them.
	It would be a mess if everyone choose their own library.
